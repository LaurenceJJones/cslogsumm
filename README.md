Crowdsec spin of pflogsumm

Inspired by [this open issue](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec/issues/1717). I always believe in options and this project aims to be a self hosted report system.

TODOS
 - Figure out how we should implement template style (EG give access to raw db client? or is it too risky? well if it self hosted it their problem if they destroy things?)
 - Provide a sensible default templates to make templating easier
 - Provide sprig v3 by default
